# Water me Game
- This is my 2nd game in java, I've been working on it for the past week with my creative colleague Raneem Al Hassan. The game is basically all about a plant that needs to be watered, and you'd have to do so by connecting a number of tubes with each other to create a path from a water tank to the plant without exceeding a certain number of movements.
